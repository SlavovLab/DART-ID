# Mac/OSX Installation

## Requirements

* Git source control management -- [download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Python >= 3.7
    * We strongly recommend using the Miniconda distribution: [download here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
    * The Anaconda distribution works as well but its 700+ packages are not strictly necessary -- [download here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows)

## Installation

Run:

```bash
pip install dart-id
```
